Understanding Asynchronous Programming:
Theory: Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
Practical: Write code examples to illustrate synchronous and asynchronous behavior in JavaScript.

Callbacks in JavaScript:
Theory: Discuss the concept of callbacks and their role in handling asynchronous operations.
Practical: Implement callback functions to manage asynchronous tasks, such as fetching data from an API.

Introduction to Promises:
Theory: Explain the concept of promises and how they provide a solution to callback hell.
Practical: Create JavaScript promises to handle asynchronous operations and demonstrate their usage with real-world examples.

Understanding Async/Await:
Theory: Describe async/await syntax in JavaScript and its benefits for writing asynchronous code.
Practical: Refactor existing code using async/await to simplify asynchronous operations and improve readability.

Promise Chaining:
Theory: Discuss the concept of promise chaining and how it enables sequential execution of asynchronous tasks.
Practical: Write code examples to demonstrate promise chaining for handling multiple asynchronous operations.

IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):
Theory: Explain what IIFE is and how it is used in JavaScript.
Practical: Implement an IIFE to encapsulate and execute code immediately within a function scope.
