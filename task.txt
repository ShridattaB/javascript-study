What is JavaScript:
JavaScript is high leval interpreted languages
used to make web pages interactive

JavaScript is like the magic behind the scenes of websites. Its main job is to make websites come alive and respond to what you do. For example, when you click a button and something 
cool happens on the webpage, that's often JavaScript doing its thing
Write a brief summary (150-200 words) explaining the purpose and significance of JavaScript in web development.


List at least three key features of JavaScript that
 distinguish it from other programming languages.

Works in Your Browser: JavaScript runs directly in your web browser, 
making websites interactive without needing to constantly talk to the server.
 This makes things feel faster and more responsive.




Objects are Flexible: Instead of having strict rules for making new things 
(like in other languages), JavaScript lets you create objects in a more flexible way.
 This makes it easier to work with different types of data and create complex things.




Can Do Many Things at Once: JavaScript can handle tasks like loading images,
 talking to a server, and updating the webpage all at the same time. 
 This means that your webpage won't freeze up or feel slow when doing lots of things,
  making for a smoother experience.


Q: What is a variable?
A: A variable is like a container that holds data in a program. It allows storing and manipulating information during runtime.

Q: Why are variables important in programming?
A: Variables are crucial because they enable programmers to store and work with data dynamically, facilitating tasks like calculations, data manipulation, and interaction with users.

Q: Can you provide examples of valid variable names?
A: Sure! Examples of valid variable names include "userName", "age", and "totalAmount". It's important to use descriptive names and start with a letter or underscore.

Q: What are the rules for naming variables in JavaScript?
A: Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. They can contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs. Variable names are case-sensitive, and it's best practice to use descriptive, meaningful names.

Q: What are the differences between "let", "const", and "var" in JavaScript?
A: "let" is used for variables that can be reassigned, "const" is for variables that cannot be reassigned, and "var" is an older way to declare variables with some differences in behavior.

Q: What are the basic data types in JavaScript?
A: The basic data types in JavaScript include strings (text), numbers (both integers and decimals), booleans (true/false), null (represents the absence of value), undefined (represents the absence of a defined value), and objects (collections of key-value pairs).
